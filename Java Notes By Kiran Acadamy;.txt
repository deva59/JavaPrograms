Java Notes: By Kiran Acadamy;

1)Java Features:
  i]Platform Independent:- 
         a} Every Java program runs on operting system.
         b} we dont need to ask customer if which operating system our using.
  ii]Open Source:
         a}It is Freely available.
         b}Any one can added/modify/changes source code.
         c}Due to that many features are added in java language.

2)Flow of Program:  
   i]Source Code:
          a}Source code create byte code and getting a run and then machine level code.
   ii]who convert source code to byte code:
          b}In this java language source code get convert to byte code by using a compiler and then lastly output consist by using interpreter.
          i}Compiler name is javac
          ii}Interpreter name is java.

Note: Byte code and Java Setup are both platform independent.
      compiler and interpreter are both platform dependent.
